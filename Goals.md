    *   **Explicit and performant** memory management.
    *   Fine-grained control over memory layout (strides...).
    *   **Strong typing** to catch dimension/type errors at compile time (via `DType` enum now).
    *   Mathematical, logical operations, indexing, **broadcasting**... everything needed!
*   **The Rust Advantage:** 💪 Guaranteed memory safety, native C/C++ performance, SIMD potential.

### 2. Automatic Differentiation (`neurarust-core::Autograd`) 📈

*   **Vision:** A dynamic, reliable, and efficient autograd engine.
*   **Key Points:**
    *   **On-the-fly computation graph** construction.
